### Tech
This game is based on very simple JavaScript, CSS, and HTML5. In use are JS if/else statements, confirm functions, CSS transitions, and JS eventlisteners.

### Broken
Currently the game is only one level, but I hope to update with multiple levels with cleaner, more functional code. If you peek at the js document you will see that elementary vanilla JS is used. 

# Installation instructions
In terminal, if you already have git installed, type the following line by line
```
git clone https://github.com/TeiganH/button-smash.git
cd button-smash
open index.html
```

### Updates
March 8th 2019 - Losing function now works
