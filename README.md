### Tech
This game is based on very simple JavaScript, CSS, and HTML5. In use are JS if/else statements, confirm functions, CSS transitions, and JS eventlisteners.

### Broken
Currently the game is only one level, but I hope to update with multiple levels with cleaner, more functional code. If you peek at the js document you will see that elementary vanilla JS is used. The only unsolved problem is that the loser function, which is only supposed to activate when any buttons other than arrows are used. Instead it currently registered only the up button as a winning button.
